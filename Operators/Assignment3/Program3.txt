Program 3

						Operators:-

1) Assignment Operators : Assignment operators are used to assign some value to variable which is used in future.
						  For eg.
						         int x = 5001236548;
								 
								 where 
								      x is variable and 5001236548 is assign to that variable.

2) Arithmetic Operators : Arithmetic operators are used to do Algebric function such as addition(+), subtraction(-), multiplication(*), division(/) and modulus(%). 
						  For eg.
						         ans = x + y;
								 
								 where 
								      ans, x, y are variables and =, + are Algebric function.
								
3) Unary Operators :      Unary operators are used to increase or decrease the value step by step or used to invert sign of it.
						   
						  1. Pre increment (++x):It increase the value in ans and x.
						  2. Post increment (x++) : It increase the value in x but not in ans.
						  3. Pre decrement (--x) : It decrease the value in ans and x.
						  4. Post decrement (x--) : It decrease the value od x but not in ans.
						  
						  For eg. 
						         int x = 10;
								 
						         ans = ++x;
								 System.out.println(ans);	//11
								 System.out.println(x);		//11

4) Relational Operators : Relational operators are used to compare two things of same data type.
						   
						  
						  1. Less than (<)
						  2. Greater than (>)
						  3. Lesthan or equal to (<=)
						  4. Greaterthan or equal to (>=)
						  5. Equal to (==)
						  6. Not equal to (!=)
						  
						  For eg. 
						         ans = x <= y;
								 
								 where 
								      ans, x, y are variables and <= is used to compare x and y.
									  
5) Logical Operators :    Logical operators are used to give digital values such as true or false
						
						1. &&
						2. ||
						
						For eg. 
						       ans = (x++ >= y++) && (--y < x++);
							   
							   where 
							        && is used to give digital vaue.
							   
6) Bitwise Operators :    Bitwise operators gives the vaue in bit that means T or F.
						  
						  1. &
						  2. |
						  3. ^
						  4. ~
						  5. <<
						  6. >>
						  7.>>>
						  
						 For eg. 
						        ans = x >> y;
								
								where >> is bit wise operator.
